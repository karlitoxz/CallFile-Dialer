Using Async leads to an OriginateResponse event which contains the failure reason if any. Reason may be one of the following:

0 = no such extension or number. Also bad dial tech ie. name of a sip trunk that doesnâ€™t exist
1 = no answer
4 = answered
5 = busy
8 = congested or not available (Disconnected Number)

See the ast_control_frame_type enum in frame.h for a complete (and up to date) list of possible reasons.
The following was derived from the Asterisk 1.6.2.0 source:

1 = Other end has hung up
2 = Local ring
3 = Remote end is ringing
4 = Remote end has answered
5 = Remote end is busy
6 = Make it go off-hook
7 = Line is off-hook
8 = Congestion (circuits busy)




---------------------

$manager = new AGI_AsteriskManager();

//Extension del agente
$channel = "SIP/100";
//Extension destino o numero externo segun dialplan
$exten = '2600';
$context = "from-internal";
$priority = "1";
$application = "";
$data = "";
$timeout = 23000;
$callerId = "SIP/100";
$variables = "";
$account = "";
$async = "";
$actionId = "";


//Conectar y llamar
$server = '127.0.0.1';
$username = 'admin';
$password = 'admin123';

if ($manager->connect($server, $username, $password)){
	$resultado = $manager->Originate($channel, $exten, $context, $priority, $application, $data, $timeout, $callerId, $variables, $account, $async, $actionId
)
	var_dump($resultado);
	$manager->disconnect();
}

--------------- Ejemplos ---------------------

Example 1
Placing a call from a SIP channel to an extension, this will cause the outside call not to be placed until the SIP channel has picked up:


Action: Originate
Channel: SIP/101test
Context: default
Exten: 8135551212
Priority: 1
Callerid: 3125551212
Timeout: 30000
Variable: var1=23|var2=24|var3=25
ActionID: ABC45678901234567890

Example 2
Placing a call from an outgoing channel to a local extension, this will cause the local extension not to ring until the Zap channel has picked up:


Action: Originate
Channel: Zap/g2/8135551212
Context: default
Exten: 101
Priority: 1
Timeout: 30000 
Callerid: 3125551212


Example 3
Executing system command:


Action: Originate
Channel: Local/1@dummy 
Application: ((Asterisk cmd System|System))
Data: /path/to/script
